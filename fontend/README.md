# React-app for La Pegatina (music band)

By connecting to Spotify, Instagram and Youtube API, we thought and built a multi-plattform quiz to play with music, videos and images related to La Pegatina world.

By playing and improving their score, the users can exchange their points for prizes like concert tickets, merchandising, trips with the band...

Wild Code School project made by students: Lena Kujath, Alecsundra Serediuc and Ruth Abelló

(Several npm packages used, as well as React Context and Hooks)

We hope you enjoy it (as much as we enjoyed developing it)! ❤️





This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Available Scripts

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn start`

yarn build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

yarn eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
